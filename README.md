# AutoTyper
*A lightweight jQuery simulated typing plugin*

## Demo
[benmansley.github.io/AutoTyper/demo](https://benmansley.github.io/AutoTyper/demo)

## Installation
AutoTyper is a JavaScript only plugin, so download autotyper.min.js and you're all set to use it in your project.

## Usage
To run the AutoTyper, use $.autoType() on the element you will be typing in. The plugin uses $.text(), so it won't work on form inputs.
The function takes 3 parameters, outlined below.

| Parameter  | Type    | Description |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------- |
| inputText  | string  | The text that will be outputted by the AutoTyper |
| speed      | number  | The speed of the typing, in ms/ character |
| skipSpaces | boolean | If set to true, the AutoTyper will type spaces immediately, with no tick of the timer |
A value of 'stop' for inputText will cause the AutoTyper to go to the end of the input immediately, shown by the 'End' button in the demo. High quality, modern flow control right there

## Known Issues
The plugin can not currently run more than once simultaneously on the same page.
